# javascript-challenge

### With this assignment, you will find two folders:   UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2, which have:
####            1.  A file called index.html to run the web-page
####            2.  A subfolder, called static with another subfolder called js 
####		    - this contains the javascript file app.js and the data file, data.js.
<br/><br/>
#### Please note that for UFO-level-2, I have added a couple of data entries for "au" for Australia, so that you can do filtering on the basis of country, which was originally all "us" for the United States.
